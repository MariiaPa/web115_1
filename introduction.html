		<ul>
			<li><strong>Personal Background:</strong> I was born and raised in Russia, but always believed that I did not belong there. So I moved to the States 3 years ago. I have a 6-year-old daughter and a 1-year-old kitten.</li>
			<li><strong>Professional/Academic Background:</strong> I work full-time as a purchasing specialist in an Austrian company. It's my second year in CPCC, I am happy to be back after my 2-semester break.</li>
			<li><strong>Background in the subject matter of this course:</strong> I took programmer classes when I was 14 years old, but was not interested in being a programmer at all, so I've never used any of my knowledge. As a result I am an advanced PC user, but not more than that. When I moved to the States I started thinking about changing my career path and I ended up choosing computers!</li>
			<li><strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong> Windows 8 at home and Windows 10 at work.</li>
			<li><strong>Courses I'm taking, and why:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>HIS-131 - I know nothing about American History and I should know more if I want to be a part of this country.</li>
					<li>ENG-112 - I want to improve my writing skills.</li>
					<li>WEB-210 - Required class</li>
					<li>WEB-115 - Required class - <a href="http://students.cpcc.edu/~mpavlen0/web115/contract.html">Course Contract</a>
				</ul>
			<li><strong>Funny Story to remember me by:</strong> Not funny, but motivational :) I really believe in the Power of Thoughts and I have proof. I've been dreaming to move to the USA since I was 12, but knew it was close to impossible. So I found a picture of a green card, photoshopped it with my own photo and information, printed it out and hung on the wall. I looked at that green card every day dreaming about getting one and...I did! I won the Lottery! (it's less than 1 % chance of winning, so you know how great it is).</li>
			<li><strong>I'd also like to share:</strong> Recently decided to be more active on Instagram - but understand that being a blogger is a hard work!</li>
