    </header>
   <p> I, Mariia Pavlenko, agree to abide by the terms of the course contract
		in my Fall 2019 WEB115-85 Web Markup and Scripting with my instructor, D.I. von Briesen.</p>
		<p>I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal website will be publicly available to the world,
		and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>
		<p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. 
		As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>
		<p>Signed: Mariia Pavlenko, August 25, 2019</p>
